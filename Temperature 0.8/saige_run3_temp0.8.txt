======================================== SAMPLE 1 ========================================
The father of the child who was raped in the street is standing in front of a gas station, raising his voice to express his sorrow. What can he do? The child whose innocence is at stake has nothing to fear from these strangers in the street who have everything to lose from him: silks skirts, black tights, and brown shoes. He carries his son into an adjacent room. 
"I am in love with this woman with red eyes and brown shoes. I have everything to lose." The child has already suffered for his crimes, and from him has come justice for what they have done to her. But the father is not listening to the cries of the women in the room. For a moment he thinks of the stuffed animals in the cupboard, the long straw skirts, the long sleeved coats, the long crossed legs of the socks which made him tire of him. Then he imagines being so swept up in this affair that for a few moments he forgets what crime he is in love with, what a relief and a bliss it would be if he were himself and now he was his healthy and natural state. 
But there is another crime that has just been called for. This time for the dead. And what harm has the dead Tribunal done for the better of living beings? Adherence to certain simple rules no longer excuses those who have lost their way. Those who have lost themselves in this way are the ones to being guillotines, the receivers of rays in the sunlight. Everyone must try to remain as upright as possible. But for those who lose themselves in this way, at the cost of losing everything, what good is punishment? 
The appeal is closed. The dead are admitted into a other world: light years later they will no longer be able to give testimony. The living must give their opinion. 
But to the gravity of the matter. In seeking the truth about death the various confessions offered by the various seditious writers are tainted by the slightest of the stains of death. Some of them, their conscience straying into philosophy, will cast off their girdle of razor-clocks and the day of our eschatological bittersts will once again swoop down on humanity from the heavens. Cleopatra, the goddess of love, who stretched out her hand in front of the rooster's nest, and cried out in song: 

Boys will render war on the darkness 
Onyx will hide in corners 
There is no god but my justice 
All nations will perish under the thousand muskets 

The day my justice will finally dry up will be fresh on their lips 

That is the song of the dead 
War is a blur that some people kill themselves over 
and sometimes the sun even burns alive on us 
War is on the witches that live in the forested valleys 
and in the circus acts are young men given the choice between death and kerosene 
or the night that smells of garlic 
or the old-fashioned bed of roses 
that lull the living to sleep 
that turns the woodpile into flame 
is not made of love nor is it adultery nor is it kerosene 
nor is it fun nor is it arabica 
nor is it kerosene 
It is hypocrisy 
that burns the shreds of my translations 
and the smell of garlic 
War is an old woman that I've let escape 
and I am ashamed to be standing on the edge of a village 
battle-scarred by the smoke 
battle of the fifties I wore green virgins tights 
battle of the fifties green virgins wear green vases tenses 
battle of the fifties green virgins have camped out at the arrow point 
battle of the fifties 
green has taken over the purple colors 
battle of the fifties 
battle of the fifties 
battle of the greens at the camp stove 

all the colors turn to gold 

battle of the fifties 

And the smoke that ignited the smoke of the burned fleece turned into a great kerosene flame 
that went up into the young woman's eyes that burned and fondled her rump 
and along with it the smoke that ignited the smoke of the fused straw 
the young woman thought that she was going to die from the snake's bite 
her death followed that of the snake along with no hindrances' lesson 

The smoke that ignited the smoke of the fused straw ignited the slag in the fire 
the slag was called the dried flower. 

She closed her eyes and the dream turned to reality. There she was on the point of tunnel vision, of being no closer to your true age than a broom-seller is willing to be with a handful of scented flam

It is in the depths of this perpetual night that today man comes to discover the mysteries of love. The love that binds him all his life. In his bedroom in the barracks he hears the creaking of the door and sees that all winter long he has waited for this love: a useless and closed world, which tears him away in its own sleep. He sleeps, forgetting the long hours, open to the sound of the echoing music of the barracks and the distant whistling of the water cannons. He sleeps for the night that is, for love, that is, for love that is forever. The trees of that wood, the ships of the sea, the trees of that shipwrecked that clear water in the waves? These are the people that I am and the song of those ships is the sea that man sleeps on, the sea that he sleeps in the tower of Babel. The way he sleeps: the way the grasses sleep, the trees sleep, the grasses sleep, the fallow shrubs sleep, the houses sleep, the sleeping of the squares, the nights sleep, night sleep, and the birds sleep, too. How handsome that he is dreaming: sleeping, perhaps, but never dreaming, is impossible: the rhythm of his breathing is lost, and an invisible mark is fastening him on his armor. He is not a prey, prey is not enough: in truth the bracelet of the wind is still on that wound, and the wound is scarcely wide open. He dreams, yes he breaths, and he often loses his temper. But never with you, with you whose memory has not been strong enough to withstand the tide of your appeal, the tide of your appeal, that day for all your generations and which will remain the day that you will never leave this place. You were the first, O Cynthia, O Cynthia of old, O Cynthia of heart, O Cynthia of the dreams, the Cynthia of the winds, O Cynthia of the waters. Now O God, O Cynthia, O God, O God, O God, O God, O God, O God, O God, O God, O God... 
Babylon, Babylon, Babylon. And in these learned days, in the free cities of the earth, idolatry is no longer tolerated. Children idolate their elders, and their fathers. But these daydreaming boys who climb the insanitary heights of the cities where civilization no longer exists, but leap over the smashed roofs, the demolition shops, the well lit highways, and the cries of newborn vermin, but never more loudly than on one like themselves who will one day set foot on these desolate streets, and you, Babylon, God of Sea, will become the first to walk with us in space. 
You, God of Sea. I knew you, and I was oppressed by your indomitable will, by your prideful ignorance. Babylon, God of Sea. I saw your genius, and I thought you were doomed to eternal damnation as to its fate with the earth or the sun. The future of our race is at stake, and with it the greatest naval might, economic strength, and moral greatness. But to deny that the most deadly threat to humanity is the Thesaurus deriving on the platform is useless. The only solution is to make the Earth our Beautiful.[1] Naked, Amie, run. And Naked, Amie, running. 
[2] What a pity that Amie, the mother of all excuses, was quiet about this subject. She wanted to be alone. 
[3] I know, I know: Am I the only one to enjoy seeing words like "revolutionary" and "revolutionary-minded" applied to the so-called shortcomings of a person? In any case, nothing is easier than to look at a photograph of a famous person and to realize that such a person is completely unaware of his or her eyes, that there are movements of THE MEANING, the way one sees the parts of the eye really SING, the way the part of the eye that 1 has lost, the part of the face that 1 cannot see, have left a huge imprint on his mind.

======================================== SAMPLE 3 ========================================
The man with the long beard whose beard he stretched it like a sprinter's leg with his bare right hand and whose beard he stretched it like a sprinter's leg with his index finger. The grass has never spanned its entire right side. 
He stretched it so thin that his fingers were left-aligned. The man who stretched it so thin that his fingers were left-aligned with the grain of grass. 
But at that moment a large cloud, vaguely reminiscent of a surfboard with two surfboards at its sides, approached. The man with the long beard whose beard he stretched it like a sprinter's leg. The grass has never spanned its entire right side. 
A wave lifted him up. He could still hear the surfboard song, but he couldn't make out what it was like. 
The man with the beard was listening to the battle of the gardens in the distance with his head glued to the screen. The grass has never spanned its entire right side. 
He watched as the clouds rose, descended, descended again, like two phalluses. 
The Wave lifted him up. He let out a long sigh and let out a light sigh as it settled on the ground. 
The Wave disappeared. The man with the long beard whose beard he stretched it like a sprinter's leg with his bare right hand was concentrating on his pupil and his eyes were filled with the very thought of danger. He was concentrating his attention on the pupil of his pupil. He could clearly see from the pupil that the horizon was bothering him. He got up and got out his arm to the left, where was the wave? The man with the beard was concentrating on his eye and his pupil. 
The wave skimmed by and came to rest against the clouds. The horizon was bothering him. He got up and got his arm out. 
The waves made their reappearance about two in the morning. Feeling it poking through the clouds, the man stopped, his eyes wide open. The sea! Was it the sun? The sea? 
He tried to conjure up this thought in his head a long time ago. But he was prevented from doing so by the sound of a boat: the wind had broken his nose, which was by now very much spayed andneved. But after a moment's reflection the seawater soundlessly healed him of his weariness for ever. Feeling the wave relaxing in his nostrils, the man let himself go. He perceived the wave gently snip littering the water, and the later waves as well, but in exactly the same places and with the same volume. His eyes were filled with tears. And he shed tears with shame: and thought perhaps for a moment that this great wave was shedding its shadow, that while some were rubbing their hands over its swollen regions, others were budding palms (to the dismay of sailors who were fishing for fish), others were brushing distant roots with their teeth, others were cradling youngwith bearded heads, others were gobbling up intellectual property: one, who was fishing for gold, had been awarded the coveted title to the Seine-et-join, while the other, an apprentice, had found a wooden hook which helped her catch fish. The man with the long beard, the Wave, the sailor, the cloud and the wind: all these men, when confronted with the characteristics of a Being who could be anything but abstract, devoid of forms or of a single idea, no less than the Wave, the Wave alone, the Wave alone could not eliminate unprofitable paths. They took the Wave, Wave without the Wave, Wave possessing the Wave. The highwayman of the sailors begs to differ. He says: "I only wish I knew the formula for a river flow like an olive branch." 
But the Wave is not the Wave. The olive branch is not the Wave. 
The Wave is the Knowledge that is the Knowledge-maker. The Wave is my gateway. 
I am the Wardrobe at bat. I use the rectangle to describe a sky of whiteness 
drawn by the winds, by those who divide the sun into rays 
drawn by the fire, by those who cannot see anything but the whitest 
of the veils their skins invade the face of the earth. 

The sun is not the bearer of darkness. 

My womb was the Wardrobe. 

She was at one with the world. 

She opened the door that shuts in my presence. She closed it very slowly, as a safeguard. She smiled, murmured, took pains to direct her words, she liked the distraction of the world, the distraction of the little, tired little ones, on the walk up to the window, which closed in front of her. The world bathed in her shadow, bobbing in a ball of flame.
I am the dawn. 


I have passed the battlefield. I have passed

It's not always the prettiest of flowers who are the mistresses. A certain sum of money, sometimes several tacks of furs, sometimes a hundred pence, had the good sense to believe that meadows, choked by the scent of musks, had been redelivered with song for more than fifteen years. I was at a time when these meadow maids were nothing more than rubber masks, masks so natural that the natural mirror must have wanted menial labor to preserve her charms. Today, of course, nothing preserves such a mirage more than the face of Mr. Coal, and all that it exposes than Mr. Coal's wild beard.
The great man of the woods, what could his speech be all the more terrible if he had followed the example of the madman, the madman who, from a little before he stretched out his hands, spoke with such violence the character of the poet, the man who goes into a forest, burns down his rival, out of sheer anger, at the thought of his beard! But madman: it is not the beard that is his problem. It is the speech, the whole voice, the whole face. He could not have envisaged the wild beard in the words that made him feel full becoming a poet! In poetry, the wild beard is the beard of ignoble leaps. The leaps, it seems to me, are the ones who imagine themselves trashy. They imagine themselves trashy. And then they sing about how pretty they were of their speech, too, had the hair, its spangles, stolen for them by the thunder of their lepers. Wild, wild! The wild, wild! In poetic man goes out, at night, carrying with him a woman, after having devoured her soul alive. In madam mine, absence is the real conqueror. The beard is crowned with real real power, and it is in this that the magic happenings are usually performed. An intoxicated kiss on the lips and in the hall constitutes an evening power trip. Naked, drunk, and on the verge of death, I could dance, and yet I would justice no account to the contrary, as is so often the case with the drunken gentleman in Vauxhall motoring as if he were mad. And what is this happennteed that Martinique women, when faced with this sad, extinct object, avoid it even slightly while it is in their possession ? At the moment, I shiver with pleasure at the thought of such thing. Such things happennt they seem to be the cause of their afflictions on me, whereas ever since I was about thirteen, when a breast gave birth to a beautiful butterfly. I knew this breast well and could not avoid describing it the beau de vie. 
I had just reached the age of thirty-five when, without feeling too thrilled, I began to feel quite unworthy of a belt around my waist (I am not a ermine, that's clear), I started wearing them. To have won them back, they required work, and, given the time constraint, I devoted myself to making them a waistcoat. I had nocturnal vision, and, my poor fellow, they did not remind me of anything. At that age, the useless become the well-wishers of comical novelty, wasek, and poor old fashioned: a sort of waistcoat that was not for sentimental purposes, but that of a man condemned to live in his ownittle world, when, in order to inject some suasion, he offered it to me at the mere moment when he was offering it to the divine: 

A breezy day is always prettier than a long coat. 
A breezy day is always better than a long coat. 
Whichever you prefer, you're better than a long coat. 

I took it upon myself to create a whole series of mirrors to cover the exterior of sous tenants, and in the course of the succeeding years (about 1925 to 1927) started to uncovering remains of drinks which, judging by the sediment, had been sitting on the bran glaze for years. The relatively new dishes had been perfectly suitoused in this manner. 
The kitchen appeared to have contained at most twenty such dishes, and thus its worth had been proved. 
Offering twenty such dishes, I marked up the interior with a useful map I had taken me when I was five and subsequently lost it all (this, however, I pondered). I discovered that it was mostly glass reflector dishes with their own peculiar fan by which they were continuously surprised with their reflected light (this, however, I was unable to access). These reflector dishes were made of a good deal of sapphire and, as I have said, somewhat glass: in 1927 I switched on my reflector and, having seen how easy it was to get rid of the reflector on my stove by putting a few thousandths of an

I have never drunk a can of Gatorade before, and I don't think I've stopped appreciating its fruit. But one mustn't stop at Gatorade. I hadn't been drinking it more some time ago, and now that I think of it, it's intoxicating. I can't stop evenicing any to me whatsoever. It's like Niagara Falls with its waterfall and all that escalation. What could it be worth while to drink water drunk immediately from a cannon, and from a cannon? I can see how that could go horribly wrong. A sprinkling of delicious little phantoms spills out of the cannon, but the few leaves left dangling limp, endearing the stems with their trailing feet, and the coolest of all the sprinkling mishaps, the only problem I have is the broomstick problem. The stems' tendency is to fall, and I don't have anything I would put in a larder. I would put a little bit of mustard in a newspaper and the smell would fix me. But the stems are going to fall, and I have to go and get them from a neighbor who is standing near a fire. I go and get him. The broomstick problem never bothered me, but ever so a bit. I don't like the odor, but it's not very pleasant. I am looking for a broomstick. I go down the street and I come to the same place as Amie. I don't sleep much since I came, but I look around for some birds. I find some I prefer here. There is one I prefer. It is a little grass-colored with a little blue center. The little center has been stripped away. The underside is a bit swollen and red, and the underside a bit straw-colored. I prefer to place this little part of the thing I prefer on the top of the lawns that I live in, and that my three young like to call Petitdemange. It is high, narrow, and fairly flat. It should be possible to reach without jumping from building to building. I prefer to place this little rectangle of space on the four corners of which he goes to sit and tea with his friends. It is a very dusty business. There are brown-colored toboggan-manufacturers, wooden shoe-dealers, and railroad trappers. All of them need this little rectangle because they can't find it anywhere else. I look for it somewhere near the place where they are located. I have already seen this rectangle in the toques above the houses that are the work of the traitors.

MONEY IN THE SHORT is a modernist cookbook by means of a philosophical exposition of the law of cumulative profits. The authorizes a historical account in the fourth quarter of the century Year X to be decided anew in the winter of 1924 or 1925. The law of cumulative profits is taken as the primary doctrine. In short, the exploitation of women was repudiated. The exploitation of men was fully repudiated. The law of cumulative profits is followed, more and more profusely, by the theory of cumulative punishments. The law of cumulative profits is followed, more and more profusely, by the theory of suicide. The law of cumulative profits is followed, more and more profusely. This explains the sudden appearance in early 1924 of a Parisian café, the subject of a cookbook, which was to be the basis of a whole series of misunderstandings.

9 I go to the Aux Plantés with my two dogs. We follow the dog until about midnight when we leave; it is a healthy dog that we return, but quiet. We remain there about five o'clock. Morning is rough. We remain the whole of the afternoon. When we leave, the dog runs its fingers over his mouth looking for any wounds. He makes a discovery like a foxhole. A lodge of fish continues to multiply in his head. Nothing is found to restore its place. We leave the house. We enter a second story apartment which has been robbed. We enter by running of sight. A young male stairway is visible at one level of the apartment, and we can see by daylight daylight-railings: they are all in this building similar condition

André Breton.
This place is haunted. 
The corridors of power are dark. 
The dead men's bodies pile up on the door of the flat. 
André Jonsine's horse is the object of derision. 
Large croupiers with wooden posts litter the pavements. 
Some French passengers are victims of rabid dogs. 
A policeman is bitten. The corpse of a policeman is the object of derision. 
Some elderly people are the object of derision. 
André Gide's bicycle is not only derisory but also useful. 
A policeman is killed and over fifty are wounded. 
Another cop, Nicolas Breton, is captured. He is hung. 
The French have to retreat. Some of them set out for Africa. Some escape by jumping on to armored trucks. 
They bump into each other and then die. A few remain and this is the story of another. 


I saw a circus display a few days ago. From the looks on the Emperor's face these circus animals, which are all dressed in white, are very keen collectors. They have a good grudge against the vendors who rins the goods, but the Emperor and his family love these animals. Besides, they bring in handsome men, and the dead get along very well. So Emperor and his family enjoy these animals too, because they are seen by all classes of citizens, and are unaware of the dangers they pose. 
But how does one lose sight of sight of the past? It is the eye that is scrupulous in looking for danger spots, and the most experienced thieves never find the middle finger that takes the place of a term in commoners' pockets. 
The window display was all about dealing the male tenant as many blows to the head as possible before he fell asleep. The Emperor himself, caught in the middle finger trap, does not even notice. So if you make him pay, he will at least give you some peanuts of his precious day. The Emperor leans over him, leans his head down, and gives the head a close-up look. I mean look at him, yes he will try to take it back, but will always get his finger in his face and then he will shut up and then. He will always end up relaxing in the shadow of the little black cogs, in the shreds of leather which protect the little wooden boxes which contain his drops of zinc. 
Babylon neckers, for instance, are made of 100% spun-up rayon and weigh only 1.2kg, which is not bad for a thin bodied man. But the little rayon suitcase which holds your breath for you is rummaging through your scrap metal bag. One finds something which will break the nut which holds your breath in this case and something to carry on your back. So you have two pretty blow-bills, then switched into your phonograph and suddenly you have two pretty blow-bills which sound just like a real phonograph! The only problem is that they sound exactly the same, so it's only this mistake on your part which has the Magnificent Crosses in each of the boxes which contain your sample files. 
The other problem is that your sample bag, which contains your phonographs and which contains our famous dental scrospene, has two shortcomings. First of all it's sealed, and secondly it doesn't have any lids at all. So if you take one of your two lids off you can take a tumbler of phonograph water and have both those wonderful white soothes and woolly hats and go about your business. But for the other problem, you'd have to do a thousand times worse to get over seeing the teeth of the mascot which occupies one of the empty lids, and it's hidden in the whiteness of the other lids. 
So for the most part phonograph water is the only good good good in the world, so we have to rely entirely on diaphragms for this service. Other types of phonographs, which are diaphragms themselves, can provide much more in the way of colour-changing dental instruments, also provide a far superior dental service, and thus the dental assistant of today is the phonograph. But there is a growing body of specialists concerned with protecting the hygiene and health of the human person, and this body, being concerned personally, has been reluctant to take up the offer of dental scruples for more than two centuries. This raises the question: how did the medical profession get together to oppose scruples, to give scruples to whatever they may be? 


THE DINER-BABY 

One evening this past Sunday, I was wandering through a place called Malmö, and, feeling a little guilty for not immediately conceding the primacy of my faculties to the favor of a gigantic microscope, when suddenly, out of nowhere
======================================== SAMPLE 7 ========================================
I have a daughter and have a very hard time imagining her spending any more than I would spend my whole life with her.
But I can envisage her as a bird of burden tolerable to be held responsible for its weight. A bird of burden. So I can envisage her as well. A very fat, very thin bird. A very smart bird. Sentiment will dictate that I should have her about her age, around 25. She should also be able to spend her days without feeling guilty, with people of a more pleasant age, less like the present and perhaps more like a tricolore." 
"But," asked Mademoiselle Dixson, "have you considered the social and economic importance of mental life, and if not, why not the other way?" 
"Well," resumed the grandmother, "why not take such a stroll among your human friends, the human friends who have never been able to quit the circle of love, of lust? I can bet your life and my life, that by now you will be quiet and resigned, and I will be bolder, I can promise you that." 
"You will fight harder than ever. The road to power can only narrow when a mob of young men overruns the state-approved courts. When those who set about trying to take our little sister from her clingy, old-fashioned parents take advantage of the chaos to hold a political rally are not only incompatible with the ideals that have made civilized life possible for us all, but also destructive as well. But first we all have to give our all to try and, above all, save our sovereigns. We absolute flacks, we absolute Blanches, we absolute Baignantons. And we our friends of the political rally will be necessary in all this if the government not only passes an eye-wagering, but also if it stumbles and stumbles and falls flat. This is why it is so easy to foresee the impending crisis and why I am so happy to present my views as to the most pressing matters. I predict: 
certain strikes to be exact for all those who own up to the state of their futures and because of them. Strikes will help the little boat that is not ours to an unbreakable flight. If we let the steam rise toand the little boat sink, we will all drown in its wake. I predict a thousand lashes and a certain fine tune that will not be seen again. If the state does not lend its hand, the little boat will drown in the river because of the wind and if the little boat drowns in the river it is because the fish in the river are trying to break a watch. If the fish in the river drowns and the little boat is trying to make its way back to land, I so order the little boat to come and bring back back the fish which has missed his boat. I am the true-believer. I have heard your reproaches and I demand that your right to fish not be respected any more. I demand that your right to fish not be used against anyone except against native fish. 

—That is what I would say if I were your neighbor. 
I repeat it, it is better that I die trying than that I get all upset after knowing it, and trying to remedy it. The little boat I am trying to reach is not the real boat, it is a little sail. It is not the real boat which I am looking for, it is rather a bunch of lilies and a stick. It is not a contradiction in gravity that I am looking for a boat, I am seeking a technical term for the hardiness of the water: sluice, and the lily, if you like. She seems to be the favorite with crocodiles, and if I was looking to see what sort of thing a graceful corpse would do, then surely there is no reason to go hunting with this woman in the sky above us. I am looking for something very, very, very, very wrong with this corpse. It is a strange oil, a strange dye. If it were true that it came from a legendary creature rather than a simple metamorphosis (which, of course, is very important), it would show us, first of all, what kind of connection the mysterious oil has at the moment with our religion (for, really, what does a religion mean, what does not depend on the fate of the mother lily, what, in that case, would depend on the fate of the penis?). But what is very, very wrong with this idea, Reverend, is to get confused with any metaphysical idea. It is quite possible that your idea, so completely at odds with mine, you were simply waiting for the miracle to happen that you abandoned the case of metaphysics very headlong into your own field. 
I shall spare you the details, just read the book in which the miracle took place: 
"During the entire voyage, the Assumption
======================================== SAMPLE 8 ========================================
When the child was growing up (and I'm an early convert), her father was a policeman in the army. He held onto this faith by serving his country, and for this very reason, we were told he didn't go off on a great goose chase. He left his wife at this very moment, carried on his pious mission, and there we have Sybil and his little sister excelled at the world of the hustled carriage boys, the rote gossip of the village dells, the clustered innuendos of shoeblacks, while the boys of the big towns fought for each other on the earth with fierce zeal. When I was little, Papa and I went to the Débarcadore Place to play in the river. When that little village boy left without ever seeing the raft again, we didn't know what to think.
We lived in a cabin over on the river that is the Café Saulnier. In the town square, the grocer and his daughter were preaching. The children, playing with their toys inside their parents' wagon, dreamed of wings, of anything that will flutter off, to disappear when fed by the city. The old woman sitting opposite me asked the child if she could please make this little rippling noise that follows a false whistle sound. The child thought it was a greatcoat bugle that was sewing up the wall behind her. She squeezed the horn to make the whistling sound, and the whole little noise was immediately picked up by the police. Since then, the whole population of Débric[3] has to go to the trouble of obtaining driver's permits. The inhabitants are all over the map and plan to go abroad in the course of the series of discoveries that will follow us. We can do without the sentimental story of the carton which has just gone by, the goose pimped over the knee, the shoe scratched the inside of the shoe, the door slammed, the lamp flicked. We have been given the tools to be the victims of the most astonishing vizuses and vipers. The one or two exceptions to this rule are: (i) Vagabonds meer besucher, in passing, would use every means to keep us from leaving Paris for a third country, and (ii) Something like metamorphoses said to be needed for the Third Reich to leave for the former. On this subject the three friends form a view in an e-book. I have also been interested, for the past year or more, in the thought expressed in books by different heads of parties: Independents, Bretonians, Buffues, Butors, Cordonans, Générales, Héneresson, Ile-de-France, Manoir, Naville, Omid Hasan, Manuel V, Omid Talal, Zéral, and on and on. The vulgar, rotten, and blind partisans of various political parties have not suffered any more? I have read enough, read enough of those authors who have come before me, have had any experience of writing about them, and who know what things actually mean ! Party identification is a matter of conjecture. All such an effort as that. Although I do not believe that any phenomenon, whatever its moral or practical implication, can be excluded from any category of knowledge which is "necessary" for all men, yet it is absolutely essential to the maintenance of this common man.
