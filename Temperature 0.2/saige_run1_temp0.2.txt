I have always loved to hear the parricide of the most important facts. It was in love that I was most obliged to return home, to a country country where I alone can now offer you my life, your tears, your tender cries, your tender pennants. The only thing I would add to your wretched eyes, those are all that remain of humanity, decency, and the most important instinct in your lips. I would also add that I do not repudiate those who, when confronted by you, willingly renounce the means of exaltation that are the fruit of a lifetime of virtue, of a bliss so much more precious than that of life itself. You are not depreciating my own in any respect, and yet you insist on being utterly incapable of seeing that I have no limits on our relationship. I have the impression of your great-aunt occasionally making eye contact with you on the porterhouse sofa. I can see it from his eyes as well. He is the type of people who habitually stops short of giving you a hint as to the kind of adventure to expect. You are the type of adventure that can be had in the shadow of the mountains, in the shadow of the rivers, in the shadow of forests. I have always, without objection, heard you tell the funny story of how, up a mountain of ancient antiquity, men brought their dogs together in one hut. After a game of trickery, the newlyweds noticed that the huskies were barkingle-rattling all the time, and decided to bring the situation to them. They thus came to me. The day before my daughter's wedding, I had gone to her flat, which was called The Bataclan, so that my wife and I could enjoy a tranquil end. I was quite taken with the place we were in that evening bemusedly called "The Bataclan" (which, as I went on to describe it, was no flotilla) and anxious to get a grip on the reality of what was to become of our beloved "The Magnificent Mac-Loufs." We were unable to leave the flat, which was becoming increasingly dark, so we could not be sure which of the doors or the upper stories was where we were going. We made steady use of the tip of a cane, who was very kindly to us. We made steady use of the tip of a cane, who was very kindly to us. We made a mental note to ourselves before proceeding; otherwise, if one were to attempt to explain the disquieting silence surrounding the place of departure, he would be deeply irritated. We could say nothing for certain about his future intentions until we left, but in this instance he made us feel at the very moment when our salvation depended upon it. 
We left without further delay, the door open for us.

"The best thing about traveling on a farm is the freedom that keeps on taking me by the hand. The freedom of never looking back, the freedom of never being afraid. Looking back, I know you. Of never being afraid, of never letting go. Of never letting go of what you love, whatever it is that takes you by the hand is at the very heart of my strength and my grace. Look at this beautiful woman. She is nowhere in the world that I love, somewhere in the world that you remind me of everything that makes her, what with the long, drawn out journey, the road that takes her wherever she goes, she finally makes up the square of our country and we are going to the sea, the square where the great grass-trenches are, the square in which I am the only one who doesn't want to go, where for all my love for the world and the square in which you remind me of everything that makes you change one day to be happy, changed again to what? butterflies? in the square, you get the feeling that your hand is always with you, that your hand always is with her. I am always ready to lend a hand, lend her a price, if she will, the feeling of the whole of human patience, the feeling of the whole of human concern for you, and of the whole of human indifference, for you, as the coat of your hand, your own hand, to take one of your skins, the whole of humanity, before long, will agree with you that I am, are not only so, but also, your soul knows how I know, too.

I have always loved to hear the story of the poet or of the poet who had so kindly lent his time and his talents to writing a hymn, a poem, which he passed on to his friends, even though their memory would have endorsed it. Poets always had a right to lend their time, even to lend their talents, but not to lend money. The most outstanding part of the past few months, the news of the arrest of a poet in the Armenian community, the surprise made by an order of a guild in the Swedish jurists, the abrogation of letters sent by my friend and intellectual collaborator Jarry to Philippe Soupault's house in Paris, all this compounded my griefs sorrow over the atrociousness of the facts, and the profound sincerity of the words which emerged from their mouths. My friends, you have no business in the country.
You are the savages of Italic lands, the savages of the poet who has inspired so many poets. You are still the savages of the Middle Ages. You are the savages of the Middle Ages. And what can we do to end this abominable abominableness? boards, viola, harp, viola, viola, viola, viola, viola, viola, viola, we have nothing against them, but they are the savages of the Middle Ages, the savages of the poem, the savages of Dante, of A.R.R.S. (Art of the Rich), and of Shelley. We have nothing against the bad taste of poets, but we must remember that we are all savages. And that we are the savages of the Good Lord. Shelley, who studied at the School of Gothic at the age of fifteen, and A.R.R.S at the School of Performing Arts at the age of fifteen, had a marvelous genius that quickly withered when she saw that she was writing, and she had a talent for bad writing that left her no choice but to restore her by means of recipes and examples. The author of sad stories and those who prefers to remember her to a days life, Breton, who was a consumptive, Lefebvre, who made wine, and so on. The end of the world has at its disposal a consumptive who can then be considered a palatinate, who can then easily substitute plaster for an enamel tongue. The author of charming stories, for whom the capacity to write at the level of a short storybook has not been attempted and, in fact, has not been attempted, would be a very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, Father Christmas.

I have tried to be as objective as possible in my criticism of the poetic methods of Baudelaire and of Max Ernst. I have even taken a more active part in this process of revisionism, in the harshest of all arrests of the critical life by means of literary critics. My general criticism is of the pure, my conclusions the consequences of which I will speak. My particular attention is to those works, even if I admit that they are sometimes, in my opinion, less vulgar than others, in my judgment, but still still still considered in the vulgar tradition. I do not consider them to be poetry at all. I consider them to be poetry in a sense limited by the term poetry to a specific form of expression, which is what the expression really is, and which is what the concrete form of expression on the one hand, and the collective expression of expression on the other, is, but is not the only difference, or the difference only in the dialective sense, of the poetic form, I mean the dialectical expression in the sense I have given it here. I do not consider them to be poetry in the strict sense that is still given to me, but in the sense that I have in mind when I speak of them.
No matter what happens with the theory of the concrete form, the concrete form must always be concerned, above all, with the contradiction of ideas, and poetry does not replace logic. The concrete form is concerned with the concrete process, and it is this contradiction of ideas, called the concrete form, which I refer to in this book, and which I believe I have finally cleared up. It is this concrete form, the concrete image which I refer to in this book, which is responsible for the various forms which I have described here, and which I believe I have finally cleared up.
The concrete form is the idea, the concrete image which I have described here. It is this concrete image, I believe, which is responsible for the appearance of particular things, of certain men, and it is this very idea, rather, which I refer to in this book, in the very near future in a veritable book-smile, to make sure of the survival of the human spirit, and to give voice to certain absurd and enigmatic ideas

I have always loved to hear the anecdotes of the miracle-worker, and the one that offers the most touching reflections on the man who, in the depths of his meditation, suddenly opens his eyes and sees only the world that he has created, and who, without any restraint, does not seem to find any other world than what he is, until the moment at which it is realised that it is his reality. And the one thing I always knew about was that he would put his head on his hands. Hands were very easily his alone words. He used to say: Hands are such a beautiful thing, even in my dream, and yet I have everything to say on this subject. I have always loved the simple, and the hand is so very comforting. I have always loved the way he looks at his hands, very fondly. When he speaks, his hands are always very dark, and I find this very comforting.
The other son-in-law was a miracle worker. He took the hand with which he was most moved by to observe the relations between plants and stones, and broke them when they touched his car, when he stepped on the branches of trees, when he rubbed his beard on the snow, when he swallowed grapes from vines. He was also content to take a photograph of a well-known bush-bird, for he held this bird in his hand, and used it to bring down figures of foliage, to bring words to the eye, to bring laughter to others, all without seeming to notice the fact that, by making these natural acts more or less visibly different from each other, he made them seem in turn to be conjoined.
The Swiss army officer who was the one who brought me back a piece of brass called the Cocteau Gramophone whose operator was the most extraordinary sight I have ever had the pleasure of hearing. This brass, which must be of extraordinary rarity, had been brought back from a mission and was as rare as bird feather. I was quite struck by the fact that Surrealism had invented a reproduction of this brass, and within a few days I had bought a reproduction of the brass which must be of such exceptional rarity that I had sought it out in a monastery a few kilometers away. There were, as I went along, with me Grammar One, and each session we practiced, the value of the reproduction of the brass. The reproduction went on to have a very special place in Surrealism's consciousness for we passed its time reuniting as one. We were sure to speak at length of this occasion, but away we went, meeting doors and taking the violins we could find our way without finding the keys. The brass we were exploring had come from a monastery and, having reached this point of the story, the whole of the brass legendaled beneath the once great song. We made love to each other for a few moments, then, and then we were alone. We took the bus back to the monastery. A door, I believe, led to the washroom of the monastery. I had found this little room on the order of the organ of the Passage de l'Opera. I sought it there only a few moments later, and in the acid-ulated puddles of water there rose a woman I have loved since. She stood motionless, her face concealed by a black felt jacket. I could not make out her expression. All I could see were the hands that control the tempest in the Wabasha radiator. Then came the cry of a little girl, and the cry of a baby. All these were present, their absence resolved me, its predictability was like a mirage. Then came its sentimental value, its right to ride a horse of all colours, or to love as it pleased, its aversion to horse-drawn cars, its right to smoke their joint in front of a mirror, its charming lack of metal hands, coupled with its abstract knowledge of history, that made me believe in a world where no-one had the right to be suspicious. 
The room was bathed in a magnificent oasis made up of a rainbow of crepe, a dragonfly, a dragonfly and a woman, with a large fountain in the middle, with a bottle cabinet, a piano and a dressing table, and a dressing room containing a lake, a sea and a church. All decorated in the most subtle tones, the furnishings were arranged in such a way that each element seemed to be represented separately, and the effect was to give a sort of abstract feeling which made people's heads spin a little. 
The room was lighted, with a good reason for being so, and it was made especially for Surrealism, which celebrated the birth of the art of alphabetic reproduction. 
The room was made especially for Surrealism because the cane window opening the inside of the drawing-room into the drawing-room with a window of the same width as the window opening in the side mirror, opening the drawing-room,

I have always loved to hear the anecdotes of the miracle-worker. In the course of a trip to the Gare Saint-Lazare, for example, I happened to be looking at an old mannequin from as old as the century have certainly made her. The old mannequin had delightedly recurted from to any desire or liking. It was made of a kind that must not be forgotten, that name that, like a siren to the flowers that it had replaced, was made of a white material, that light that could not be separated from its beak, and that a head decorated with a true saint, that no reflections from an eye disfranchise us from that holy site where the most precious of human virtues are venerated with open arms: the mannequin manufactory.
The mannequins were invented by painters who had the unfortunate desire to spare, in the last analysis, and by the greatest generation of photogrammetry in human history, the mannequinsorves sold off in the crash of the second-rate state-of-the-art state-of-the-art insurance-company in a region becoming more and more subject to the note of the manias, the urban legend of the financial crisis, the news of the war in his name, the seers' studies of the highest order, the phonographs of every kind, the mannequinsorptive system, the mannequin in particular, had already attracted the greatest attention, both as a practical phenomenon and as a remedy. Indeed, the mannequinsorves industry was enormous, stretching from Europe to Asia, from Africa to the Mediterranean. It consisted of many different designs of cheap, useless body armor that were sold together under different names, and it had proved so popular that the state-of-the-art photogrammetry system, in its turn, up to that point had been unable to resist the repeated application of it.
It was, as it was then and as it is often used, the corpse of the mannequin. Under the guise of the mannequinsorves industry, the state-of-the-art system offered customers the choice of purchasing or selling bodies, as well as the choice of a set of fins for underwater demolition. The system could be divided into three classes: body armor, body armor-bombers, and body armor-robbers. The system offered the most convenient methods of compensation for the least out of service, as well as the most disadvantage-a-rama: the bidder could, at will, choose from several improvements which the seller had promised him, items which had been inadequately deserved, or from one's worst, as he saw it, to his best. The system was simple: the best and the most honorary men and women had been given the gold medal, the best being divided between those who have performed admirably and those who have been poorly paid. But the bidding began to wane. The best minds were most thoroughly distrustful of each other's hands: so much the worse for legend. And so the auctioneer began to feel the echoes of his own folly, the echoes of his own folly being those of a false and very grave impression made by a few people, that part of the person who feels when he thinks someone else have felt his, and then those of a false and very grave impression made by a few people, that part who feels when he thinks someone else have been silent. A few auctions then took place, firstly to elect great men, secondly to distrust the judgment of crowds, thirdly to convulse the imagination of the people, and finally to pay homage to the man who had once paid for his mistake with his mistake. The former place added a few extra buttons so that when the key was pressed it would be possible to change the look of the covers of the blazers, which had become part of the finished piece. The latter placed a small blue check mark on the key so that if the key was pressed the blimp would proceed along with a hurried motion. The former let the child slip a little piece of paper so as to read the inside of the box which contained the following inscription:

I have always loved to hear the parricide of the most important considerations of life. It is a pity that the advice of a psychiatrist is no longer being given to the service of which it is furnished.
Psychiatrist, you are an affront to psychiatry. You have turned a blind eye to the epidemic! It is not my job to go and see it. I shall be called upon to say what has been the cause of the present disorder. But since you have such a point of view, it would be a crime for me not to have one of those opposite one of the two main outlooks which have brought about this state of affairs. You have no business in leading a house of worship which I revere. No religion, no business. I shall be damned, like you, if I am not careful to show my face in public. I shall greet the stars with the same dignity I do with the gift of my mind to surgery. I will look at you in a way which is both familiar and respects your kind of expression.
I am sojourning in your house is not the first time I met a psycho. It is a common trick for people to becalme them, and it is funny what happens when this communication is done with the fake name of the probate judge. Trafalgar Square, real estate agent, with fake beard, I shall be sure to tell you everything. The real purpose of your letter of departure is to obtain a divorce from Trafalgar Square. I don't live there any more. I leave itaratical to you.
My wife, your heart breaks at the mention of my name. Why should I bother to inform you about the court's decision on a suit brought by one of the tenants of this square against the company which occupies it, the City of London Council? The tenant, a man with a complex history of mental illness, has won, by a preposterous margin, considerable concessions for the demolition of the second floor of the Hotel Dupont. But the concession might have gone a step further, for if the lease had not been in effect this objection might not have been raised to the third floor by now that the alarm bells have been sounded. This objection might have been raised by the tenant who occupies the groundfloor of the Hotel Doubleday with a violent history of malignant tendencies. But the matter is before the competent judicial district.
I have no intention of changing this sign in my view. I merely regret that this square which so many of our fellow-tesks and travellers consider our homespun and comforting, at the very moment when we need it the most, most in order to rest, is being used up completely of all belonging to the world’s mass and unendowed mass. It is time to leave it, and since this sign is expecting the world, I am behaving badly at home.

My wife’s body, a fine piece of furniture, was the only thing that kept me from leaving this room. We have not eaten since, and it is very dark. The clock on the door says noon. We have not eaten since. The walls of the room are covered with posters that say:

The walls are adorned with signs that say:
THE SPEAKER
1225 N.E.

The doctor is open to any stranger. He will give the street address. He also offers to give taxi drivers and police officers a taxi if they sign up at his window. The policeman, a 25-year-old with a long criminal history, will be happy to take the car with the red-faced young man. But the young man, the young woman, he offered to take the car with the same tint. We have had great pleasure in showing you, in this instance, how easy it is to get carriedlled by the idea of the young woman we are talking about. She was quite taken with the whole affair. She knew quite well that we would go to Mar-Renee, where the funeral of the Biennale BiD is to be arranged, but she added: "It’s not like Mar-Dor. It’s not like Mar-Dor. It’s pretty there if you like." We shall see next year, after the funeral of course. She was a real survivor. I was last night remembered in her home town, the big one for sure.
As for the other residents of the world, they are all too aware of the dangers they risk when they live by these conventions: the high street (Rue de la Chausée), the high street itself (L’Industrie), the high street itself (Lower Rue de la Grande Armée), the high street itself (Lower Rue de la Grande Armée), the high street itself (Lower Rue de la Grande Armée), etc. etc. etc. etc. etc. etc

The first thing I do when I see a woman is to kneel beside her beloved. But if I am going to know her, I have to know her whole life. And to know her whole life with all the abandon and emotion that a decomposed woman makes, with her hair, her eyes, and her whole being. I have not only to do, but also very well do amon, I mean do an excellent, very well, wonderful, without getting lost. I am not always in the presence of this woman. Sometimes I even go so far as to go barefoot. I am in the presence of women. Absolutely no such luck.

I have always loved to hear the anecdotes of the miracle-worker. The most famous of these is that of Roquefort, who, on the edge of a journey through the Amazon, found himself sucked into a machine whose fumes and dust he could no longer exhale, and who, unable to get off the plane again, found himself obliged to put his hands on his knees before a mirror in order to confirm his initial belief that the sky is a vast blue drum. The tales he had heard were too touching to refuse, and he was so moved by that, that he decided to tell my mother about those miraculous machines he has never tried. This machine which allowed him to look at himself in his mirror and said to himself: I am a machine of the universe. It was as though I could take a walk in the far reaches of this marvelous jungle and see the flowers growing in every corner. 
The American woman of the '70s, when she was asked to describe a representation of the miracle, replied: Of all the divinities, this is the person whose image will reproduce, remembered and whose part he will play in the tragedy to come. She was so determined to produce a work as touching, so determined herself to complete with an amusing book of conjectural observations, that shead of mice, which sealed the deal. She lived by the sad, the insipid stories: shenequins, the cats in the pictures, the flights of stairs and windows opening up at the back, the way, in the '70s, boys on the go, the use of confectioners, of course, which made the fabulous naive, the worthless, and the worthless will never again forget this reassuring story. She closed her eyelids one after the other, leaned on a switch, and took in the world in her free eyes. She never dreamed of transcending the glass, of following the rule of chance, of following the straight lines of which reason alone knows no theerest. She saw the miracle as a certain need, a need of the Negro, of a Negro who could not read, and who did not have a written word. She saw him as a symbol of everything that was, was not simply meaningless in the modern sense of the word, but literally fatal to any hope of becoming a woman: "If you knew in your heart of gold that you were going to die without ever having felt so alone any more, you would imagine that for the first time in your life you were going to have a woman of color, a woman of color without ever being alone."

Another woman, the mother, the grandmother, the grandmother of the great swathe of the U.S.A. population, was the most powerful, if a tragically obscure, representative of this dying word. I was growing old, I was thinking of my great-aunt, the grandmother. 
Multicolored, multicolored, multicolored. I could have left her, of course, but I chose the far, far more satisfying, and more beautiful, the far eastern one, which was as far as the Mac-Loufs and the Bolivars were from here, as far as the neighborhood is concerned, and farther still as far as the grandfather is from here, as far as the brother from here is from here, as far as the aunt from here is from here; from there the mother one, the grandmother one, the grandfather one. 
The name Negro, the mother, the grandmother, the Negro, the Negro, the Negro, the father, the father, the grandfather, the grandfather, the grandfather—had been forgotten in the minutes of my life when my mother, in choosing a name that did not clash with any that I cherished, chosen with the background of his or her own life, and when, in the course of years to come, she chose a name that echoed her joy, the joy of the complete disappearance of her, and when, in the course of years to come, she chose a name that echoed her disappointment, the disappointment of the fact that life was not always so beautiful, that life was not always so beautiful, and that there were always those who still did not know what was called beauty. 
In the last analysis, there were two realities I lived in common with during the last thirty years: a reality I know named Mar- Roule, and an imaginary one named Arrigoni, for whom I have always, and without the slightest hesitation, attributed the privilege of being alive. 
Neither of us was born with a reality, a fact or an imaginary. I was born with a reality, and an imaginary with which I have always converseed. I am, however, aware of the harm that lies ahead for me, and the need for ever-increasing awareness in order to give back, in the process of renouncing my former identity, what is lost, what gains the search for knowledge has saved, and in order that truth, in all

I have always loved to hear the anecdotes of adventure. I have always laughed when I saw them. And I am not the kind to let the games get in the way of my great adventure. So I am perhaps missing the mark of those who tell you to get along just fine. At least keep an open mind.
The road to that great bronze throat that has just the two women's lips pursed is long. And there is plenty of time for everyone.
