      <description>======================================== SAMPLE 1 ========================================
We find ourselves on the quay the scene of one of those legendary cathedrals not often found in the world: the Senegalese, it may be, but the urbanaeous has never offered anything new, anything that might be termed a formal ally. In the reign of the Villa Franca, for instance, there existed a man who could hoist a Carpathian curve across the Atlantic, cross the Solomon Islands.</description>

In a sense I&#39;m in love with that redheaded creature who sits at the foot of my bed and breathes me away. At one time it was a fern coloured pinky its colour of feverish folly. Now it&#39;s a pinky with a violet throat and a violet-coloured nose. She hangs her hair in both directions in a dishevelled bun. It&#39;s a long bun with white flaps between the sleeves and a long white oblong at the front.</description>

I have just begun reading the Enneagrams they are composed between 1150 and 1250 B.C. They were composed between 1150 and 1250 and have, as I have indicated, some interesting parallels with earlier works, such as the Enneagram et al., from 1129-1175 (the same year as the last work I was reading) and En Procugina en la Lucha (1129-1175) (see my comment below for the latter&#39;s title and its connection with earlier En Procutes).</description>

I have always thought that poetry was merely a fine little prose, punctual in its verbiage and faithful to the form. But, in my opinion, it fell short of this purpose. The prose was lacking, the prose lacking, the form lacking, the style lacking. And it still is: the stage is not quite ready. The stage is. Tito [Tristan] Rodiet&#39;s marvelous little live performance of the Policliet’s tormented night.</description>

      <description>======================================== SAMPLE 5 ========================================
We are a family: grandfather, great-grandfather. We are all born to play. Born with aplomb. But we take it upon ourselves to take advantage of each other. Every night we go to sleep, we beg each other to return. And if we should beget one another in the streets, we we we&amp;ndash;we we&amp;ndash;we&amp;ndash;we&amp;ndash;we&amp;ndash;too often we fall asleep, tired of this game, this game, and that game, that heart: love.</description>

      <description>======================================== SAMPLE 6 ========================================
I am a pretty blonde, so the idea of being blonde is hard to swallow. I&#39;ve had pretty blonde cheeks before, and a pink one a few years ago when I was in high school. I also had a pink eye turn on me a pretty eye just the same. But now, I&#39;ve had lips so pink I can&#39;t even put one understatement. And a mouth so pink, so red, I can see it now, almost nightmarish-blue, in a man whom I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll never meet.</description>

      <description>======================================== SAMPLE 7 ========================================
I have found a simple way of making the cracks in the walls of silence disappear. A simple light saber is stretched out on the table.
&amp;lt;|endoftext|&amp;gt;
LIKE A COLD STORM
By SUN
From the depths of silence
Alight from love that fades
From the fleeting
Through the lukewarm night
Through nothing at all
Perhaps there are other lovers
Like us
We are like you

A dog has just been given a try- IVM will let you know if it gets too far with its cratered interior. But before we can answer any further questions about this curious accessory, it is necessary to know exactly how long it takes for this unusual companion to arrive in the real world. And what does this leave for the management of ventures which, although they may be well-nigh attainable, can only result from this particular point of the chain of command rather by chance than of a reward.</description>

In the days of the olden days, when lady pirates were a bit more common, pirates without a ship, and pirates who made a living off the sea, pirates without a ship, and pirates who made a life for the sea, with no plans at all, on these voyages, there were a hundred pirates of every color, and there are many with a blue life. Today, there are more pirates than ever: customs officers, heads of hair, shipwreckers, pirates who&#39;ve stolen a by stripping their foes of their beards and feathers, divers who&#39;ve left a smile on their wake, pirates who&#39;ve wrecked ships, treasure hunters, treasure hunters with their obsessions, treasure hunters who&#39;ve forgotten their saddles, treasure hunters who&#39;ve forgotten their hands, treasure hunters who&#39;ve hung their nets on the reefs, treasure hunters who&#39;ve forgotten their scales, treasure hunters who&#39;ve rented the parlours, treasure hunters who swear by a god with hearts of stone, treasure hunters who swallow pills, and treasure hunters who beat their chests with pencils.</description>

This is the last image I&#39;ll bring up, however, it already offers a good illustration of the kind of intervention of the Surrealist attitude which I have always found in great part to be lacking, the attitude which takes precedence over all my other ideas the attitude I have the power to call upon, having the good sense to prefer to the others. I am a burden to be carried along with me, and it is the attitude of aiming higher than I am that carries me along.</description>

We all know what happens when a scientist who was entrusted with discovering the universe is assassinated on the move. This scientist&#39;s life is in danger. His son is already in high school. The doctor&#39;s wife is in a foreign land and the father-in-law are in difficult physical conditions. Their son is a scientist working for a big country.* (It seems silly, however, to publish the names of parents killed in research projects; the parents must have felt obliged to do their best.</description>

Our country is in a state of emergency, which means that the only thing that can be expected from it is that civil war break out in the north-east of France, between the Communist Party of Great Britain and Ireland and the Revue la peinture ise, which seeks to take France by force of arms. Ireland, which occupies the frontiers of both the two countries&amp;rsquo; main ports of transport, boasts one of the world&#39;s largest Communist parties, which has also been of great help to the Party of Ireland in this struggle.</description>

I have always loved the poetry of gestures, moreover, of PLAIN, and OF THIRST, for I regard them with a great view of amazement. As a matter of fact, I have seen these gestures, FACILITIES AND FACILITIES. These FACILITIES ARE GRAF, AND THEY ARE FREE. THEY ARE EXCELLENT. THEY WERE BEING FREE THE FIRST SEASON.
[1] G. MacMillan, Armand Breton.[2] ‘The Restaurant Grévain?], p. 45.[3] [4] A curious way of looking at it: is the word inn on the lips of the dollar bill worth the word innkeeper really all that good in this town?</description>

What can he do? The child whose innocence is at stake has nothing to fear from these strangers in the street who have everything to lose from him: silks skirts, black tights, and brown shoes. He carries his son into an adjacent room.</description>

By Amie
It&#39;s not always the prettiest of flowers who are the mistresses. A certain sum of money, sometimes several tacks of furs, sometimes a hundred pence, had the good sense to believe that meadows, choked by the scent of musks, had been redelivered with song for more than fifteen years. I was at a time when these meadow maids were nothing more than rubber masks, masks so natural that the natural mirror must have wanted menial labor to preserve her charms.</description>

I have never drunk a can of Gatorade before, and I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve stopped appreciating its fruit. But one mustn&#39;t stop at Gatorade. I hadn&#39;t been drinking it more some time ago, and now that I think of it, it&#39;s intoxicating. I can&#39;t stop evenicing any to me whatsoever. It&#39;s like Niagara Falls with its waterfall and all that escalation. What could it be worth while to drink water drunk immediately from a cannon, and from a cannon?</description>

André Breton.
This place is haunted.
The corridors of power are dark.
The dead men&#39;s bodies pile up on the door of the flat.
André Jonsine&#39;s horse is the object of derision.
Large croupiers with wooden posts litter the pavements.
Some French passengers are victims of rabid dogs.
A policeman is bitten. The corpse of a policeman is the object of derision.
Some elderly people are the object of derision.</description>

I have a daughter and have a very hard time imagining her spending any more than I would spend my whole life with her. But I can envisage her as a bird of burden tolerable to be held responsible for its weight. A bird of burden. So I can envisage her as well. A very fat, very thin bird. A very smart bird. Sentiment will dictate that I should have her about her age, around 25.</description>

When the child was growing up (and I&#39;m an early convert), her father was a policeman in the army. He held onto this faith by serving his country, and for this very reason, we were told he didn&#39;t go off on a great goose chase. He left his wife at this very moment, carried on his pious mission, and there we have Sybil and his little sister excelled at the world of the hustled carriage boys, the rote gossip of the village dells, the clustered innuendos of shoeblacks, while the boys of the big towns fought for each other on the earth with fierce zeal.</description>
